This program was written for use with Python 3.8.6 64-bit on a Windows machine (although it should run fine in other operating systems)
It also requires an installed version of the 'numpy' package, the program was tested with version 1.19.3 (as there were issues running
other versions with windows) but any numpy installation should have all the functionality used in the program. It also requires an installation 
of the 'matplotlib' package for the graphs.
