Code was run using python 3.8 64-bit
Two non-default packages were used: NumPy and Matplotlib, both can be installed on any machine via pip.
Most code does what it says, ie 'Question 1' is the code used to generate the data in question 1.

Code labelled 'graph output' produces graphs based on saved data, so won't work unless the corresponding normal program 
has been run and its data generated and saved to file.
